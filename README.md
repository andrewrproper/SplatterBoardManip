# SplatterBoardManip

*A painting and image manipulation program created using C++, OpenGL, and QT3.*

Copyright 2002 Andrew R. Proper

SplatterBoardManip features drawing tools including point, line, 
square, circle, and triangle. It also features image manipulation 
tools which filter the image to create a unique result. The drawing 
tools have adjustable colour, brush size, and gradient degree. The 
image created can be saved in common image formats, and can be 
re-opened later for further modification.
 
This program was written for my Computer Graphics class in 2002. In this 
class my final grade was 99%. I thoroughly enjoy graphics programming.
